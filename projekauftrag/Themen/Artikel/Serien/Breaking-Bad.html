              "Breaking Bad" tells the story of Walter White, a brilliant but
              underachieving high school chemistry teacher who receives a
              devastating terminal cancer diagnosis. Faced with mounting medical
              bills and a desire to leave his family financially secure, Walt
              makes a desperate decision. He teams up with a former student,
              Jesse Pinkman, to use his chemistry expertise to produce and sell
              the purest crystal methamphetamine on the market.

              What begins as a misguided attempt to provide for his family
              quickly spirals into a dark, thrilling journey into the criminal
              underworld. Adopting the alias "Heisenberg," Walt's ambition,
              pride, and ruthlessness grow, transforming him from a
              mild-mannered family man into a feared and powerful drug lord. The
              series masterfully explores themes of morality, power,
              consequence, and the fine line between right and wrong.
            </p>
