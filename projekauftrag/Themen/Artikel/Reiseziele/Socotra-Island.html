              Socotra is an island archipelago in the Indian Ocean, belonging to
              Yemen. Its extreme isolation and harsh, dry climate have resulted
              in a unique and spectacular endemic flora. It is so unique, in
              fact, that it's often described as the "most alien-looking place
              on Earth."
            </p>
            <p>
              The island is most famous for the Dragon's Blood Tree (Dracaena
              cinnabari), a strange, umbrella-shaped tree that produces a dark
              red resin, known as "dragon's blood." This resin has been used for
              centuries in medicine, incense, and as a dye. Along with the
              Dragon's Blood Tree, Socotra is home to hundreds of other endemic
              plant species, including the bizarre Bottle Tree (Adenium obesum
              socotranum).
            </p>
            <p>
              Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its "outstanding
              universal value" due to its incredible biodiversity, visiting
              Socotra is a dream for adventurers, botanists, and anyone seeking
              a truly off-the-beaten-path experience. It represents a journey to
              a landscape that feels like a remnant of a prehistoric world.
