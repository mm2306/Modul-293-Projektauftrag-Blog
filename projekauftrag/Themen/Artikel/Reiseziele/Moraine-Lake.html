              Moraine Lake is a glacially fed lake nestled in Banff National
              Park, Alberta, Canada. Situated in the majestic Valley of the Ten
              Peaks at an elevation of about 1,885 meters (6,183 feet), it is
              one of the most iconic and photographed locations in the entire
              Canadian Rockies.
            </p>

              The lake's stunning, vivid shade of turquoise is its most famous
              feature. This incredible color is a result of sunlight refracting
              off the rock flour‚Äîfine-grained particles of silt‚Äîthat is
              continuously deposited into the lake by the surrounding glaciers.
              The color is typically at its most intense and brilliant in
              mid-to-late summer when the glaciers have melted sufficiently.
            </p>

              Visitors can experience its beauty from various perspectives. The
              most famous viewpoint is from the top of the Rockpile Trail, a
              short but rewarding climb that offers the classic vista seen on
              postcards and banknotes. For the more adventurous, several hiking
              trails start from the lake, leading into the pristine alpine
              wilderness of the Valley of the Ten Peaks. It is, without a doubt,
              a bucket-list destination for any nature lover.
