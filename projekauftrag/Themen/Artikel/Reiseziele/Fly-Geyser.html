              Fly Geyser is a small geothermal geyser located on a private ranch
              in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada. What makes it so remarkable is
              that it wasn't formed entirely by nature; it's a fascinating
              example of an accidental human creation transformed by natural
              processes. It was created in 1964 after a geothermal energy
              company drilled a test well, which was then improperly sealed,
              allowing dissolved minerals to rise and accumulate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the decades, this accumulation of calcium carbonate has
              formed a large, cone-shaped mound, or travertin, that stands about
              1.5 meters (5 ft) tall and continues to grow. Hot water constantly
              erupts from multiple spouts, creating terraces and pools on the
              desert floor. The geyser's brilliant red, green, and orange colors
              are not from paint, but from thermophilic algae that thrive in the
              moist, hot environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              The geyser is located on private land, the Fly Ranch, which was
              purchased by the Burning Man Project in 2016. Access is restricted
              to guided nature walks, making it an exclusive and mysterious
              destination. This blend of accidental art and natural wonder makes
              Fly Geyser a unique spectacle and a goal for those who seek the
              weird and wonderful.
